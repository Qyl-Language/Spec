# Spec
- Simplicity & Readability: Someone coming from another language could easily write and read Qyl code without extensively learning the language.

- Ease of use: Complex tasks can be accomplished easily.

- Portability: Run on multiple platforms and architectures, with similar performance on each. There is nothing that runs one one machine that doesnâ€™t run on another.

- Minimalism: Qyl should be small and lightweight, a quick download for a quick language.

- Performance: Qyl code should compile and run quickly, regardless of the machine is it being run on.

- Efficiency: Qyl should only allocate the necessary memory to get the job done, nothing more, nothing less.

- Flexibility: Qyl should be a highly flexible language that will allow you to do whatever you want it to.

- Innovation: Rethinks the way that we code today.
